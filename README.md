# Module_11_Web_Scraping

I worked with classmates to completed the assignment. 

Identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. ALso, learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

This new assignment consists of two technical products:
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

Requirements
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Automating browsing was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted using Beautiful Soup
The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted.
The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data 
The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas/splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types.
The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file
